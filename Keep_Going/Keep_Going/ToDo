1. To work on "work in background" to be able to remind user about his goals > DONE
    * reminders are working > DONE
    
    * implement reminders to be scheduled in preferred reminder time > DONE
>>>    * perform test of reminders <<< IN PROGRESS
   
2. Improve "isitStrike" function because checking always entire history is not effective - inRowCheckDate have been added, now isItStrike function have to be updated to start from that date > TO BE CORRECTED if app is not oppened it will not notice that some trainings have been missed > DONE
3. Add to Goal "user motivators" - possibility to add frazes, words that motivates user to achieve his target => perform task; These "user motivators" (I guess togather with app motivators) will be used by "reminder"
>>> 4. Improve notification permission checking - in case app doesn't have necessary rights, show at least warning or ask for permission <<< IN PROGRESS
5. Add introduction/onboarding elements to explain how to use application.
