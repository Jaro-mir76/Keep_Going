1. To work on "work in background" to be able to remind user about his goals > DONE
    * reminders are working > DONE
    
    * implement reminders to be scheduled in preferred reminder time > DONE
>>>    * perform test of reminders <<< IN PROGRESS
   
2. Improve "isitStrike" function because checking always entire history is not effective - inRowCheckDate have been added, now isItStrike function have to be updated to start from that date > TO BE CORRECTED if app is not oppened it will not notice that some trainings have been missed > DONE
>>> 3. Add to Goal "user motivators" - possibility to add frazes, words that motivates user to achieve his target => perform task; These "user motivators" (I guess togather with app motivators) will be used by "reminder" <<<
4. Improve notification permission checking - in case app doesn't have necessary rights, show at least warning or ask for permission - DONE
5. Add introduction/onboarding elements to explain how to use application > DONE
6. To be fixed:
    - app badge seems to show all goals, no only planed for today - DONE
    - introduction tips - last one - edit of goal - it doesn't work because mainEngine.selectedGoal = nil is set in the EditGoalView and Main view somehow needs to know if last save was newGoal or Edit - DONE (probably not perfect but DONE)
    - reminders - in some situations, for example when it is not oppened for longer time it stops to show reminders - to be analysed - problem is that at some point in time there is not active goals and new background taks is not scheduled and entire process stopps >>> change approach, instead of scheduling background taks schedule directly reminder, and once there is not goals for current day schedule reminder for first goal next day - DONE
